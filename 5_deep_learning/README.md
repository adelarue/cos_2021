Hello everyone!

I am looking forward to (re)introducing you to Deep Learning (DL)!

The program I prepared for you is dense so that it can benefit each one of you, whether you know nothing about neural networks, or eat ResNets for breakfast!
No prior knowledge in DL will be assumed.

The session will be organised in four parts of 30 minutes each, the last one being optional:

Part 1 will cover fundamentals of Deep Learning including Perceptrons, Feed-Forward Neural Networks, Gradient Descent, Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks.

Part 2 will be a tensorflow tutorial with Google Colab and Python, where we’ll build an MNIST digit classifier with 99%+ accuracy, with feedforward and convolutional neural networks.

Part 3 will introduce various tips, good practices, good research pipeline and creative ideas.

Since these 3 parts are already quite intense, I decided to make Part 4 optional for people interested to go further. I intend to give you high level explanations of numerous advanced Deep Learning architectures - including Encoder-Decoders, Auto-Encoders, GANs, Transformers - and buzzword concepts, like few-shot learning, meta-learning, federated learning or reinforcement learning.

As you can see, I planned to talk about many different topics, but I also hope to make the session interactive, try to answer any questions you have, and directly involve you into a Deep Learning researcher mindset!

Pre-assignment will take you less than 5 minutes:
Google Colab is a user interface to execute Python code. It is extremely similar to Jupyter Notebook, except that it is online and runs on GPUs, for free!
Please go to this link and make a copy of this repository to your Google drive.

Then check you can execute cells, and upload a screenshot to Canvas of the CHECKPOINT cell after you ran all previous cells as well.

See you soon!
