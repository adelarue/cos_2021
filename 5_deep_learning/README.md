# Introduction to Deep Learning

I am looking forward to (re)introducing you to Deep Learning (DL)!

The program I prepared for you is dense so that it can benefit each one of you, whether you know nothing about neural networks, or eat ResNets for breakfast!
No prior knowledge in DL will be assumed.

### Slides are here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/62e2ae0traqbkk2/Intro_to_Deep_Learning.pdf?dl=0

The session will be organised in four parts of 30 minutes each, the last one being optional:

### Part 1: Fundamentals of Deep Learning 
Includes Perceptrons, Feed-Forward Neural Networks, Gradient Descent, Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks.

### Part 2: Tensorflow / Keras tutorial with Google Colab and Python
We’ll build an MNIST digit classifier with 99%+ accuracy, with feedforward and convolutional neural networks.

### Part 3: Tips, good practices, good research pipeline and creative ideas

### Part 4: Advanced Deep Learning architectures and buzzword concepts
Architectures: includes Encoder-Decoders, Auto-Encoders, GANs, Transformers,... 
Buzzword concepts: includes few-shot learning, meta-learning, federated learning, reinforcement learning...

## Pre-assignment (takes less than 5 minutes):
Google Colab is a user interface to execute Python code. It is extremely similar to Jupyter Notebook (see Session 4), except that it is online and runs on GPUs, for free!
Please go to this link and make a copy of this repository to your Google drive.

Then check you can execute cells, and upload a screenshot to Canvas of the CHECKPOINT cell after you ran all previous cells as well.

See you soon!
