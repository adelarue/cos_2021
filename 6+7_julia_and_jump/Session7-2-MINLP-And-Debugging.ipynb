    "2) **Adjust your expectations**\n",
    "   * Adjust the solve time: if you obtain a feasible solution, then you can terminate early.\n",
    "   * Adjust the optimality tolerance: since your data is probably not error free, the benefits of closing the optimality gap from 1% to 0% are probably limited.\n",

    "    * Branching strategies (construct the tree in a smart way).\n",

    "  * Apriori lower bounds (e.g. from QCQP, SOCP, SDP).\n",
