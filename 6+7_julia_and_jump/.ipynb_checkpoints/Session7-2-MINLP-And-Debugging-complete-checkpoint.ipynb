    "2) **Time taken** (fast is every user's favourite feature).\n",

    "1) **Test your code regularly, with real data**\n",

    "    * Your data (even if you acquired it from a well-known repository).\n",
    "    * Your code.\n",
    "    * Julia (the solver interface (CPLEX.jl, Gurobi.jl), JuMP, Julia base.).\n",
    "    * The solver: I have personally seen bugs in both CPLEX and Gurobi, open-source solvers are even less reliable.\n",
    "  * You need to create test scripts before you start developing Julia code, and run these every time you make changes to your code, or update anything, to verify correctness.\n",
    "      * This includes changing your Gurobi version, executing Pkg.update().\n",
    "  * Synthetic data makes for bad test cases: if possible, use real data (e.g. from repositories, the literature).\n",
    "   \n",
    "2) **Adjust your expectations**\n",
    "   * Adjust the solve time: if you obtain a feasible solution, then you can terminate early.\n",
    "   * Adjust the optimality tolerance: since your data is probably not error free, the benefits of closing the optimality gap from 1% to 0% are probably limited.\n",
    "   * Improve 3-4.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3) **Get Better Relaxations**\n",
    "  * Cuts (improve the lower bounds).\n",
    "    * Tune solver cuts.\n",
    "    * Add clever problem-specific cuts.\n",
    "    * Branching strategies (construct the tree in a smart way).\n",
    "    * Subproblem solution strategies (how we solve each node of the branch-and-bound tree).\n",
    "  * Apriori lower bounds (e.g. from QCQP, SOCP, SDP).\n",

We refer to this set of outcomes as an uncertainty set. \n",
